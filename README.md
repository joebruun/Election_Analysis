## Election Audit Summary

### Two Examples for Modifying the Script:

- The script can be modified to find the greatest number of votes for filters other than candidates and county. If the data included other characteristics, such as demographics and geography, the script can be modified to include these characteristics and the analysis can be broken down even further.

- The script can be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. We could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate, allowing us to see which candidate was the most popular within a certain county or geographical area.
